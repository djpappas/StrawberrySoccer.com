<b>Match Schedules</b>        
The ONLINE Schedules are the OFFICIAL schedules of the Strawberry Soccer Invitational. The Tournament prints a Program Book and provides it to the teams at Team Registration. Schedule changes introduced after the program publication (commonly seven days before the event) will not appear in the booklet. The online schedule is considered the definitive version.        
        
Each team will be scheduled for a minimum of 3 preliminary games. A maximum of 2 matches will be played on any one day.        
Referees will be USSF certified.        
        
<b>Forfeits</b>        
Failure to complete a match, or a team leaving the field during play, will result in forfeiture. No team that has forfeited a game will be declared a group or wild card winner. The team winning by forfeit will be awarded the average number of goals they score in their other games, rounded down to the nearest integer, (with a minimum score of 1-0). The opponent's score will be zero. This score will be the official score in case goal differential is necessary. The Tournament officials reserve the right to decide all matters concerning a forfeit. In no case will a team which has forfeited a game be declared a group winner or wild card. If a team arrives more than 15 minutes late for a match the Tournament Committee, at their discretion, may declare the game to be a forfeit depending upon the situation. A team failing to field the proper number of players at the scheduled time, or at any time during the match, will forfeit the game. All 7v7 teams must field a minimum of five (5), 9v9 teams must field a minimum of six (6) players. All 11v11 teams must field a minimum of seven (7) players. If the minimum number of players is not maintained, that team will forfeit that game. The scores of forfeit games in this manner will be scored as described above in this paragraph.        
        
<b>Procedures for Determining a Winner</b>        
Immediately after the game both coaches and the game center referee will sign the game card certifying the final score which will then be delivered to the HQ tent at each site. The tournament scorer will be responsible for updating the website at: www.strawberrysoccer.com. Posted scores will reflect a maximum goal difference of 4.        
        
<b>Standings and Tie-breakers</b>        
No overtime periods will be played for Preliminary games. Each team will be awarded three points for a win, one point for a tie, and no points for a loss.        
In the event of ties in the group standing, the following procedure will determine the group winner:        
<ol>        
 <li>Most Points</li>        
 <li>Head to head competition</li>        
 <li>Highest number of total NET goals (goal differential).</li>        
 <li>Maximum goal differential per match is four (4), e.g. if a score is 4-1, the goal differential is 3 for the winner and -3 for the loser. For a score of 7-2, the goal differential is 4 for the winner and -4 for the loser.</li>        
 <li>Fewest goals allowed</li>        
 <li>Penalty kicks (FIFA laws of the game apply, see Penalty Kick Elimination below). If both teams advance, the Tournament Director will decide the opponents at the next level of play.</li>        
</ol>        
<b>Penalty Kick Elimination</b>        
When Final matches are still tied after overtime (see overtime times in the Laws of the Game above) the FIFA laws of the game for Penalty Kicks apply. Only players on the field at the end of the second overtime period are eligible for penalty kicks. Coin flip will determine who will go first (visiting team calls). Five penalty kickers per team. The most goals scored after five kicks for each team wins the game. If the score remains tied, teams will alternate shooters until there is an unmatched goal between the teams. After all eligible players, including goalkeepers, on the field of play have taken kicks; teams will start with their first kickers again and in the same order.        
        
<b>Games interrupted in the first half:</b>        
<ol>        
 <li>If the first half has not been completed and the game is stopped, every effort will be made to complete the game, or play to completion of at least the first half and record the score as final.</li>        
 <li>Games shall be considered completed if the first half has concluded. The score at the stoppage of play will be the final game score.</li>        
</ol>        
<b>Games interrupted after the completion of the first half:</b>        
Will continue if time permits or, if time or other issues, as determined by the tournament, does not permit the game to continue, the current score at the time when the game is terminated will be the final score.        
Note: If necessary, game lengths may be shortened to accommodate scheduling requirements and/or weather conditions. It is the responsibility of the head coach to check Tournament Headquarters for any reschedule information.        
        
For more information regarding schedule changes consult the website at www.strawberrysoccer.com        
        
However, in the event that rescheduling is not possible, and game cancellation creates a situation where teams within the division are unable to play an equal number of qualifying games, the group winner will be determined on the basis of awarding the average tournament points earned in the other games, to the teams that were unable to complete an official game, followed by the tie breaking procedure if necessary. The team with the highest average points will be declared the winner of the group. In the event there is a tie which cannot be resolved by point averaging, the advancing team will be determined by a coin toss, or penalty kicks, per FIFA as directed by the Tournament Directors.        
        
<b>Match and Score Reporting</b>        
Scores will be posted as quickly as possible. Coaches should report any discrepancies to Headquarters prior to their next game.
