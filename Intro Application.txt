<b>COMPLETING THE ON-LINE APPLICATION FORM</b>     
     
<b>STEP 1:</b> Complete the application. ALL REQUIRED FIELDS MUST BE FILLED IN or the application will not be accepted. BE SURE TO SUPPLY AN EMAIL ADDRESS THAT IS RELIABLE AND ACCURATE as this is the ONLY way we will contact you if your team is accepted.     
     
<b>STEP 2:</b> Once you hit Submit, your application will be sent to the tournament. THE FORM WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED if you do not supply an email address or fail to check the verification boxes at the very end of the form.     
     
<b>STEP 3:</b> When you submit your application, you will be given a web page that contains your <b>Team ID Number</b>. You should make two copies, one to keep on file and one to mail with your fees. YOU WILL NEED YOUR TEAM ID NUMBER TO CHECK YOUR STATUS, CONFIRM IF ACCEPTED, MODIFY YOUR APPLICATION... pretty much anything that has to do with the tournament. As this is also your private log-in code, you should be careful about who has access to it.     
     
<b>STEP 4:</b> Pick up your email. You should have a completed application certificate for each team in case you couldn't print the page on Step 3.
