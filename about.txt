On behalf of the Trojan Soccer Club (TSC), the Troy Strawberry Festival and all of our partners, I would like to thank you for considering the Strawberry Soccer Invitational as an event for your youth soccer team.  All but a few of this year's participants were not alive when we started hosting this event in 1998.  Like the this year's players, we've grown up considerably from our first year.  While the size of the event has grown over that time, we like to think we've improved the quality of the tournament more than simply its size.    
    
Our focus over the years has been on maintaining a small town feel.  Troy, Piqua, Tipp City and Pleasant Hill are all smaller communities with a nice hometown feel.  Our sites are all smaller than traditional tournaments commonly offer with easier access to parking.  Tournament headquarters at each location are visible and centrally located amongst all of our fields.  Also, we limit the number of commercial vendors to avoid the carnival atmosphere favored at many tournaments.    
    
At the same time, we draw teams from Kentucky up through Michigan and from Indiana to Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  As a result, while our tournament provides a smaller setting, your team can expect a varied and challenging level of competition.  We offer multiple levels of competition for teams varying in age from 9 to 19 for both boys and girls.  The tournament strives to offer mid-tier teams a challenging degree of competition.    
    
Feel free to reach out using our site contact form if you have any questions.  We also can be contacted on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StrawberrySoccer/">Facebook page</a>.
